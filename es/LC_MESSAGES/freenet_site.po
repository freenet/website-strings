"      <p>\n"
"    For best performance, Freenet will run continually. It should\n"
"    not interfere with your computer usage, as it requires around \n"
"    200MB of RAM and 10% of one CPU core, plus some disk access. We \n"
"    strongly recommend you shut down Freenet while playing computer \n"
"    games etc. On Windows you can do this from the system tray icon, \n"
"    on other systems use the links on the system menu or the desktop.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"    Normally Freenet will connect automatically and should \"just work\",\n"
"    automatically connecting to other nodes (Strangers). However,\n"
"    if you know several people who are already using Freenet, you can\n"
"    enable high security mode and \n"
"    <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8888/addfriend/\">add them as "
"Friends</a>, \n"
"	so Freenet will only connect to them, making your usage of Freenet \n"
"	almost undetectable, while still being able to access the rest of the\n"
"	network through their friends' friends etc. This will be slower unless \n"
"	you add 10+ friends who are usually online when you are.\n"

"	  <h3>Mirrored installation</h3>\n"
"	  \n"
"	  <p>\n"
"	    If you have a working Freenet installation directory that you have "
"mirrored \n"
"	    from one Unix machine to another (e.g. via rsync or\n"
"	    unison), enabling the mirrored installation is not\n"
"	    difficult.  Nothing in a Freenet installation cares\n"
"	    about its host's IP address; it can't, or Freenet would\n"
"	    fail on machines that get IP addressss from a DHCP pool\n"
"	  </p>\n"
"\n"
"	  <p>\n"
"	    All you actually need to do is tell the system you've\n"
"	    mirrored to that it should start the Freenet proxy\n"
"	    daemon for you on boot.  Do <tt>crontab -l</tt> on the\n"
"	    source machine, find the line that is tagged \"FREENET\n"
"	    AUTOSTART\" and add that to your crontab on the mirrored\n"
"	    machine.\n"
"	  </p>\n"
"	  \n"
"	  <p>\n"
"	    However: each installation has a unique identity key\n"
"	    generated at installation time. If you try to run two\n"
"	    instances with the same identity <em>at the same\n"
"	      time</em>, both proxy demons will become confused and\n"
"	    upset. Don't do this!\n"

"      <h3>Firewalls and routers</h3>\n"
"      \n"
"      <p>\n"
"	Freenet should work fine with most routers, but if you are having problems\n"
"	and you have a firewall or router, click <a href=\"faq."

"      <h3>So it's running, what do I do?</h3>\n"
"      \n"
"      <p>\n"
"	When the installer closes, it should open a browser window pointing to\n"
"	the first-time wizard. Here you can configure basic settings, and then\n"
"	start using Freenet. You can access Freenet later on via the system tray\n"
"	menu (bottom right on the screen), or use the Browse Freenet shortcut on "
"the \n"
"	desktop and/or start menu. If it doesn't work, open \n"
"	<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8888/\">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</a> "
"in your web browser.\n"
"      \n"
"      </p><p>\n"
"	For best security you should use a separate browser for Freenet, \n"
"	preferably in privacy mode. On Windows, the system tray menu will \n"
"	try to use Chrome in incognito mode if possible. Internet Explorer does\n"
"	not work well with Freenet, Firefox and Opera are widely\n"
"	used.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"      \n"
"      <p>\n"
"	If you know anyone running Freenet, you can improve your security and \n"
"	help to build a robust network by connecting to their node. First, open the "
"\n"
"	<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8888/addfriend/\">Add a friend "
"page</a>. You and your\n"
"	friend should each download their \"node reference\". Send the file to\n"
"	the other person, and add his node reference using the form at the bottom\n"
"	of the page. When both are added, your friend's node should show up on the "
"Friends \n"
"	page, probably as \"CONNECTED\" or \"BUSY\". You can set a name for your node\n"
"	on the config page to make it easier to see who it is. Only add nodes run "
"by people\n"
"	<b>you actually know</b>, whether online or offline, as adding total "
"strangers\n"
"	harms performance and does not improve security much (they could be the bad "

"      \n"
"      <h3>So I'm connected, what do I do?</h3>\n"
"      \n"
"      <p>\n"
"    Freenet itself includes anonymous websites (\"freesites\"), filesharing, "
"searching, and \n"
"    more, but you can also use third party \n"
"	applications for chat, filesharing, to help you upload freesites, etc.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"    \n"
"    <p>The <a href=\"http://freesocial.draketo.de/\">Freenet Social Networking "
"Guide</a> explains how to set up\n"

"	If you have problems installing or running Freenet, please contact us on\n"
"	<a href=\"mailto:support@freenetproject.org\">the support list</a> \n"
"	(<a href=\"lists.html\">subscribe here</a>), or join us on IRC on the\n"

"      <h3>Hardware requirements</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"    Generally a 1GHz processor and 1GB of RAM should be fine. Freenet will "
"run on smaller\n"
"    systems, but it uses at least 128MB of RAM, so unless the system\n"
"    does nothing else it will struggle in less than 512MB. However, the \n"
"    processor is less of a problem, people have been known to run it on "
"400MHz Pentium 2's or\n"
"    ATOM's, although downloads and browsing would be slow.</p>\n"
"    \n"
"      <p>\n"
"	Freenet will use a portion of your disk for storing data, \n"
"	you can configure this to any size from 100MB upwards, but\n"
"	we recommend at least 1GB. Freenet also uses disk space for\n"
"	your downloads. Freenet's memory usage is approximately\n"
"	256MB plus 400kB for every 2GB of datastore.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"      \n"
"      <p>\n"
"      On 64-bit Windows, we will install a 32-bit Java Virtual Machine "
"because \n"
"      of limitations of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wrapper."
"tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/download.jsp\">Java Service Wrapper</a>.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"      \n"
"      <h3>Upgrading</h3>\n"
"      \n"
"      <p>\n"
"	Freenet provides an update-over-freenet mechanism:\n"
"	It will keep itself up to date automatically from other\n"
"	Freenet nodes, and this will normally work even if it is\n"
"	unable to route to them due to them being too new. This is\n"
"	anonymous and secure, and we recommend people use it.\n"
"	However, if something is severely broken, you can update\n"
"	your node manually from our servers:</p>\n"
"      \n"
"      <ul>\n"
"	<li>Windows users can upgrade to the latest-stable Freenet\n"
"	  release from the system tray menu, or by running \"update.cmd\" in the "
"Freenet\n"
"	  directory.</li>\n"
"	<li>Mac and Linux users may upgrade by running the\n"
"	  update.sh shell script in the Freenet directory.</li>\n"

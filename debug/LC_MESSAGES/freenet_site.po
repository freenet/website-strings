"Freenet is a self-contained network, while Tor allows accessing the web "
"anonymously, as well as using \"hidden services\" (anonymous web servers). "
"Freenet is not a proxy: You cannot connect to services like Google or "
"Facebook using Freenet. However, Freenet has websites, filesharing, forums, "
"chat, microblogging, email etc, all anonymous and hosted within Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet is a distributed datastore, so once content is uploaded to Freenet, "
"it will remain on Freenet forever, as long as it remains popular, without "
"fear of censorship or denial of service attacks, and without needing to run "
"your own web server and keep it online constantly.\n"
"\n"
"The other big difference is that Freenet has the \"darknet\" or Friend to "
"Friend mode, where your Freenet node (software on your computer) only "
"connects to the Freenet nodes run by your friends, i.e. people you know (and "
"maybe to their friends, to speed things up). This makes blocking Freenet, e."
"g. on a national firewall, extremely difficult.\n"
"\n"
"However, most people currently use Freenet in \"opennet\" mode (that is, "
"connecting automatically to whoever the network assigns, rather than "
"connecting only to their friends). This is much less secure than using "
"Freenet in \"darknet\" mode, and is relatively easy to block, as it does "
"have some central servers (\"seed nodes\").\n"
"\n"
"Freenet has many unsolved problems, and is still experimental. Our objective "
"for Freenet is to build a global friend-to-friend darknet, which would be "
"extremely difficult to block, and would provide very strong anonymity and "
"censorship resistance. This will require further work on Freenet, on "
"usability, speed and security, but above all it is a techno-social "
"experiment: Will people know enough friends who are willing to use Freenet "
"to make such an anonymous friend-to-friend network possible? This is why "
"Freenet supports \"opennet\" mode: to let people try it out before they ask "
"their friends to connect.\n"
"\n"
"Tor is a little less experimental, and arguably is an easier problem; it may "
"provide better anonymity today, provided that it isn't blocked, and of "
"course, Tor lets you access the internet as a whole, whereas on Freenet you "
"can only access Freenet content. However if you can use a large enough "
"darknet, Freenet already provides an interesting level of censorship "
"resistance, DoS resistance and anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"Using the internet \"anonymously\" is not necessarily easy: Connecting to "
"Facebook through Tor doesn't prevent Facebook from knowing pretty much "
"everything about you, and connecting to your (non-HTTPS) webmail account "
"through Tor may mean the person running the proxy (\"exit node\") can steal "
"your webmail account password.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet is a separate network, which does things differently, because there "
"are no central servers. This is why we don't support Javascript, server-side "
"scripting etc on freesites: Everything must be rewritten to work on a "
"distributed network. But the advantage is there is no single server which "
"can be compelled to hand over your private communications or which can be "
"shut down.\n"
"\n"
"There are still risks, for example, talking about your home town or internet "
"provider on an anonymous forum, or downloading files which Freenet can't "
"make safe such as PDFs or word processor documents (Freenet will warn you "
"about this). Also, for web content in particular, it may be easier to upload "
"it to Freenet than set up a hidden server on Tor; you don't need to keep "
"your node online for your content to be available, you don't need to figure "
"out how to configure it safely, and most important, if you go away your site "
"will still be available.\n"
"\n"
"### Summary:\n"
"\n"
"Tor (or I2P):\n"
"\n"
"*   Lets you access the Internet (but be careful!).\n"
"*   Lets you access anonymous web servers and other services.\n"
"*   Lets you host anonymous web servers, which need to be kept online, and "
"can be DoS'ed, but can run any dynamic or server-side content you want.\n"
"*   Provides reasonable anonymity\n"
"*   Has been blocked by several countries, with varying success. Even its "
"hidden bridges can be harvested and blocked with moderate effort.\n"
"*   Is somewhat centralised\n"
"*   Is more mature and has more users and developers\n"
"\n"
"Freenet in general:\n"
"\n"
"*   Only lets you access content uploaded to Freenet, including (static) "
"websites, email, filesharing, forums, microblogging, etc. All of which are "
"anonymous (or pseudonymous i.e. you create an untraceable identity).\n"
"*   Hosts content in a distributed way: You don't know what your node is "
"storing, any given content is distributed across many nodes.\n"
"*   Ensures that popular content will be available forever.\n"
"*   Is older than Tor, but more experimental (arguably it's a harder task).\n"
"\n"
"Freenet in darknet mode: (friend to friend: connects only to your friends' "
"nodes)\n"
"\n"
"*   Is very hard to block, and this can be improved further with transport "
"plugins.\n"
"*   Provides good anonymity, and with a bit more work it could provide very "
"strong anonymity (PISCES tunnels).\n"
"*   Is fully decentralised: No central servers at all.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet in opennet mode: (connect automatically even if you don't know "
"anyone on Freenet)\n"
"\n"
"*   Is relatively easy to block.\n"
"*   Provides limited anonymity\n"
"*   Is somewhat centralised\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately most people use Freenet in opennet mode currently. The big "
"question is can we build a global friend-to-friend darknet? Join us and find "
"out!\n"
"\n"
"PS for an example of how dependant Tor is on centralised hidden services, "
"see [this](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rlo0uu) [bust](http://"
"arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-"
"busted-for-child-porn-distribution/). Half the hidden services on Tor were "
"using a single hosting service, whose owner has now been arrested. While we "
"don't approve of these sites, it does illustrate the point: A centralised "
"network is a vulnerable network. Unfortunately, decentralised networks are "
"hard, but in the long run they are more secure."

"The Chinese national firewall (Golden Shield) has blocked our website for "
"many years, and was observed in 2005 to block the 0.5 protocol as well. This "
"suggests China doesn't like us, so be careful if you run Freenet in China. "
"Some other countries (e.g. France) are known to be hostile to peer to peer, "
"and may eventually force ISPs to block peer to peer networks (but right now "
"Freenet works fine in France and we have many French users!).\n"
"\n"
"Technically, Freenet 0.7 has some minimal defences against blocking; the "
"protocol is relatively hard to identify (we are working on [\"transport "
"plugins\"](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Transport_plugins), which would "
"[make it much harder to detect Freenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Steganography). Freenet supports a [darknet](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/"
"Darknet) mode (i.e. only connecting to your friends) which makes automated "
"harvesting and blocking of nodes very difficult. Note that many mobile "
"internet providers block all peer to peer networks along with other content, "
"and many corporate or academic networks may block Freenet (but even if they "
"don't, see [you shouldn't run Freenet at work](#trouble) for non-work "
"purposes!).\n"
"\n"
"There has been discussion in the US and UK of legislation to require "
"backdoors and presumably blocking of anything that can't be backdoored. This "
"is unlikely to pass, especially in the US, where similar laws have been "
"proposed periodically and are probably unconstitutional. However, even if "
"the government came to us and demanded a back door, we would be legally "
"unable to secretly distribute a trojan'ed build, because Freenet is open "
"source, numerous people have contributed code to it, so legally we have to "
"give you the source code, including that for any government mandated back "
"doors - which wouldn't be secret for long! If this happened it is likely "
"that [Freenet Project Incorporated](donate.html), the non-profit "
"organisation that runs this website and handles donations, would shut down, "
"but the Freenet network itself would live on just fine, the only difference "
"being not being able to pay full time developers as easily.\n"

"This is related to [\"Is Freenet legal?\"](#legal). We have done everything "
"we can to make it extremely difficult for any sane legal system to justify "
"punishing someone for running a Freenet node, and there is little precedent "
"for such action in today's developed countries. Many legal systems recognize "
"the importance of freedom of speech, which is Freenet's core goal. Having "
"said that, there is risk in doing anything that your government might not "
"agree with; you should make an informed decision as to whether to take that "
"risk. Furthermore, your ISP or hosting provider may have a problem with "
"Freenet. At least one French hosting provider has been known to ban Freenet "
"(along with Tor and others) from their servers; please read your terms and "
"conditions to make sure you are allowed to run Freenet. Note also that "
"Freenet can use rather a lot of bandwidth, at least 20GB/month, and this may "
"be a problem on a cheap or shared connection. And of course running it at "

"**Short answer:** Probably, on opennet. Maybe, on darknet.\n"
"\n"
"**Long answer:**\n"
"\n"
"Freenet has a different threat model to Tor and the Mixmaster remailers. "
"Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be "
"robust, and content must be distributed without requiring a central server, "
"whether anonymous or not. Anonymity is important for requesters and "
"especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical "
"example is a corporate or government whistleblower. Generally to find the "
"originator of some content, the attacker must be able to predict the data in "
"advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and "
"must be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after "
"that, it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and "
"the originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by "
"overwhelming force the attacker is connected to the whistleblower (or e.g. "
"seizes the computers of everyone on the network), he may be able to identify "
"this much more quickly. All of this is vastly more difficult on a darknet, "
"where everyone connects only to their friends, where it is very hard for an "
"attacker to find nodes, and where to connect to a given node he must social "
"engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play), "
"but darknet is far more secure, and far more difficult to block on a "
"national firewall.\n"
"\n"
"Tor on the other hand is designed to anonymise real-time data streams, on "
"the assumption that the list of nodes can be public, that there is a free "
"world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial "
"content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or "
"upload it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so "
"on. And Tor has a concept of a \"client\", which is somebody who uses the "
"service without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays "
"data for its neighbours. Hence the attacks on Freenet are completely "
"different to the attacks on Tor. Both compromise to some degree to enable "
"more or less real-time performance.\n"
"\n"
"If you can use the darknet, trust your friends, don't reinsert files, always "
"use the \"Insert a random, safe key\" option, and change your anonymous "
"identity after some volume of inserts, you should be relatively safe using "
"Freenet. However this has not yet been quantified. If you can connect, build "
"up some trust in your anonymous persona, insert your controversial content, "
"and then disappear, again, you are better off with Freenet, especially if "
"the content is a website (but if you are connecting on opennet, beware of "
"seednode compromises). In some other cases, Tor is better.\n"
"\n"
"We are still working on Freenet's security and there are major security "
"enhancements which have not yet been implemented, most of which will go in "
"before 1.0\\. Cryptographic tunnels similar to Tor's onion routing are one "
"possibility, which would greatly reduce the impact of many of the below "
"attacks, but there are several other enhancements planned, both to anonymity "
"and to network robustness/undetectability.\n"
"\n"
"**Major known attacks:**  \n"
"In the interests of giving would-be users as much information as possible, "
"and on the assumption that any serious attacker would do their homework, "
"here are the major classes of attack on Freenet we are presently aware of:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Harvesting**: Simply by running some powerful Freenet nodes, an "
"attacker can identify most of the opennet (Strangers network) relatively "
"easily. These nodes can then be attacked one by one (subject to resources), "
"their traffic analysed, or simply be blocked on a national firewall. "
"Connecting only to friends (darknet) largely solves this problem. ISPs may "
"be able to identify Freenet nodes with some effort, although we make this "
"fairly difficult: Freenet's current protocol is designed to be hard to "
"detect, and steganography will be introduced at some point. However, traffic "
"flow analysis, or brute-force blocking of all peer to peer traffic (e.g. "
"traffic between IP addresses marked as \"consumer\" rather than \"business"
"\"), both of which would hit a lot of things other than Freenet, would "
"likely be effective for quite some time.\n"
"*   **Bootstrapping attacks**: Unless a node only connects to friends, it "
"will have to connect to the opennet \"seednodes\" to announce itself and get "
"initial peers to connect to. At the moment there are relatively few "
"seednodes and the list is maintained manually. The seednodes could be "
"blocked easily by a national firewall etc, but also, there is little to "
"prevent attackers from setting up their own seednodes and submitting them, "
"and then \"capturing\" any new Freenet users who connect to their nodes, in "
"order to observe their traffic etc. Freenet will try to announce to multiple "
"seednodes, but see the below section on \"correlation attacks\", which "
"generally are feasible with only a single connection to the target. So this "
"is a question of resources - if the attacker has the resources to surveil "
"all new Freenet nodes, he has a good chance of pulling it off. In future we "
"may have more seednodes, and only reveal a small proportion of them to each "
"node, as Tor does with its hidden bridges, but that will not prevent "
"attackers from creating lots of malicious seednodes and getting them into "
"the official lists, and it will likely still be possible to block all the "
"seednodes with some effort (something similar has already happened to Tor "
"hidden bridges in China). Combined with harvesting and adaptive search "
"attacks, this attack explains why opennet is regarded by many core "
"developers as hopelessly insecure. If you want good security you need to "
"connect only to friends. Hit and run inserts are possible, and can be "
"relatively safe in terms of many of the other attacks, but you are taking "
"the risk that the opennet seednode you connect to may be malicious.\n"
"*   **Datastore attacks**: This is largely solved as of build 1224, we don't "
"cache our local requests or inserts, and neither do the nodes immediately "
"connected to us, to a depth of at least 2 hops (3 on inserts). However, if "
"your node is older than that, seizing the store might give a bad guy some "
"interesting information. Also note that the client-cache caches local "
"requests (but not inserts), so it should be encrypted and passworded by "
"setting the physical security level to HIGH, or turned off. You should also "
"encrypt the swapfile in particular and the whole system if possible to "
"prevent information leaks from the web browser, media players etc. Note that "
"some incriminating data (e.g. the list of bookmarks) is still stored in "
"plaintext; we're working on it, but did I mention you should [encrypt your "
"whole system](http://www.truecrypt.org)?\n"
"*   **Correlation attacks**: If you are connected to a node, and can "
"recognise the keys being requested (probably because it was posted "
"publicly), you can show statistically that the node in question probably "
"requested it, based on the proportion of the keys requested from that node, "
"the locations of nearby nodes, the HTL on the requests and so on. This will "
"be largely eliminated by tunnels (but these will be quite expensive so may "
"need to be turned off by default except for predictable blocks), but in any "
"case it requires a rather powerful attacker compared to the next attack... "
"Note also that if you only connect to your friends, a remote attacker will "
"have to either co-opt your friends or social engineer you into giving them a "
"connection; either way, connecting to the entire network this way is rather "
"expensive: If they already suspect you personally they'll probably bug your "
"keyboard rather than trying to connect to your Freenet node!\n"
"*   **Adaptive search**: If you want to find the author of some content, and "
"you can predict the exact keys which will be inserted, and you are able to "
"connect to new nodes at will, you may be able to listen out for the keys, "
"guess where they must have come from, connect to nodes near there, and if "
"your guess is correct, get more keys which gives you a more accurate fix on "
"the originator, so the attack gets faster and faster and eventually "
"converges on the originator. This attack is most powerful with inserts of "
"big, predictable files, but the \"Insert a random, safe key\" option will "
"make the keys unpredictable even if the content is guessable, by using "
"random encryption keys. The downside is it produces a different key each "
"time for the same file, and you can never safely reinsert the same file to "
"the same key. Given that Freenet's data persistence is currently relatively "
"poor, this is a problem. Anyway, if you _can_ use the random keys option, "
"the attacker is unable to move towards you until after you announce the "
"file: Most of his samples will come not from the actual content inserts but "
"from chat posts. There are far fewer of these, and changing your "
"pseudonymous identity periodically will help, provided the attacker cannot "
"easily connect the new identity to the old one. Using a dedicated identity "
"for posting sensitive content, which doesn't chat too much, again will help. "
"Another thing which makes a huge difference is connecting only to your "
"friends (i.e. using darknet): This makes it extremely difficult for an "
"attacker to get new connections closer to where he thinks you must be, just "
"as it helps with correlation attacks. So the biggest problems with this "
"attack are 1) Files which are not very popular fall off Freenet relatively "
"quickly, so need to be reinserted, but it is not safe to reinsert to the "
"same key (this is why we have the \"Insert a canonical key\" option, for "
"those who don't care about attacks), and 2) Chat can still be attacked. "
"Tunnels will help to deal with both problems, and by default will only be "
"used for predictable keys so can be relatively slow without this causing "
"problems in practice. Also there is work going on on various techniques to "
"allow users to do reinserts safely via for example preventing the attacker "
"from seeing requests started before he connected. Another important point is "
"this only works if the source is uploading new content, or chatting, "
"regularly; creating and bootstrapping a new pseudonymous identity over a "
"short period, doing a single insert (of any size) with the safe random key "
"option, and announcing it, should be relatively safe from this attack, even "
"on opennet - but see the section above on bootstrapping attacks.\n"
"*   **Traffic analysis**: Freenet provides minimal protection against global "
"traffic analysis (basic message padding etc); if the attacker also has nodes "
"on the network, the extra data will likely be helpful. We certainly do not "
"guarantee that it is impossible to trace data transfers from one node to the "
"next with detailed traffic data, however it is hoped that this will fall "
"down on the busier nodes. One day we will implement steganographic "
"transports and/or constant bitrate links as an option for more paranoid "
"users. Note that on Tor-style networks, global traffic analysis will defeat "
"the network completely: all that is needed is to observe both the entry and "
"exit points.\n"
"*   **Swapping attacks**: It is possible to attack the location swapping "
"algorithm, and thereby disrupt routing on friend-to-friend networks. This "
"has been demonstrated by the authors of the Pitch Black paper. We are "
"working on a solution, but sadly at the moment most users use opennet.\n"

"Short answer: no.\n"
"\n"
"Long answer:  \n"
"We don't think so. Aside from protecting freedom of speech, Freenet is also "
"designed to be an efficient dynamic caching system. If information is "
"requested a lot from a limited number of nodes, the nodes that the requests "
"pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. "
"If information is inserted on a limited set of nodes and then subsequently "
"requested a lot from a separate set of nodes, with repetition, the sets will "
"close in on one another in the network topology until they are \"neighbors\" "
"and only the originally targeted nodes are suffering from the attack.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to "
"consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually "
"insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload "
"for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and "
"capacity greater than the total of the entire network, it is possible to "
"cripple any public network (including the Internet itself) with floods, but "
"it is our intention to always keep Freenet as resistant to this as "
"theoretically possible.\n"
"\n"
"Curiously enough, the above analysis only applies to [Opennet](https://wiki."
"freenetproject.org/Opennet). On Darknet, you might have a little more "
"success, although it would be much harder to change your entry point in any "
"significant way. Nonetheless, you have a reasonably low bandwidth multiplier "
"(the total number of nodes visited, around 20 on average), and you are "
"severely limited by the number of nodes you can connect to, which will be "
"low on a darknet."

"The existence of malicious nodes within the network is the most difficult "

"Freenet is based on a balance of positive and negative feedback loops that "

"First of all, we **strongly** suggest that you install Freenet inside an "
"encrypted drive using, for example, [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/). "
"It is not possible for Freenet to prevent all leaks of private data, "
"especially if you download media files etc. Even if you only browse "
"freesites and use the chat plugins, there will still be potentially "
"incriminating data in your swapfile, which needs to be encrypted (on recent "
"versions of Windows you could try the command \"fsutil behavior set "
"encryptpagingfile 1\", but really the solution is to encrypt your whole "
"system including swap). It is also essential that you use your web browser "
"in privacy mode, or with cache and history turned off; we try to do this if "
"you launch Freenet via the rabbit icon, but there are no guarantees as "
"unfortunately this functionality seems buggy in current web browsers. "
"Browser plugins could also be a problem, and you should use a separate "
"browser for Freenet if in any doubt. Be careful with the files you download "
"from Freenet - not only could anyone seizing your computer see you have them "
"(media files are likely to be written to disk even if you open them directly "
"in your web browser and never save them), but also they could contain "
"threats to anonymity themselves, such as calling back to a malicious website "
"etc; this is possible in for instance PDFs and some video formats. Freenet "
"tries to warn you about this when it can't filter out such malicious "
"content: Currently it can only filter HTML pages, GIF/PNG/JPEG images and "
"CSS, and MP3s, but we will add support for Ogg soon and other formats later. "
"And of course there are many other threats - you should take standard "
"security precautions, such as not running operating systems that are no "
"longer updated, not running software not from a trustworthy source, using "
"appropriate security software etc (if you have a firewall make sure it "
"allows the two UDP ports Freenet needs through).\n"
"\n"
"Because not all users will have installed encrypted drives at the time when "
"they first install Freenet, Freenet itself attempts to encrypt all the "
"potentially incriminating data that it stores on disk. Details are below but "
"as explained, leaks are inevitable: you really should [encrypt your disks!]"
"(http://www.truecrypt.org/)\n"
"\n"
"The main datastore does not store data you request or insert (or that is "
"requested or inserted by nearby nodes), because it can be probed by other "
"nodes: This was introduced to fix [this attack](http://www.theregister.co."
"uk/2005/05/13/freener_not_so_anonymous/) publicised by The Register. Freenet "
"has a separate client-cache, which stores data which you have recently "
"requested to avoid having to go back to the network every time (which would "
"not only reduce speed but also security, by giving attackers more "
"opportunities to see your requests). Also, Freenet stores the list of your "
"downloads and uploads (which you can see on the Filesharing menu), their "
"current progress, and various other data, in the file node.db4o (or node."
"db4o.crypt). The actual data is kept in the persistent-temp-* directory. "
"Unless you set the physical security level to LOW, this data is encrypted. "
"At MAXIMUM, the encryption keys are never written to disk, so the data is "
"effectively wiped on restarting the node; otherwise the encryption keys are "
"stored in a file called master.keys (on HIGH this is passworded). You can "
"wipe the data by either using the panic button on the downloads/uploads page "
"or by securely deleting master.keys. Freenet also creates temporary files "
"for other requests, which are also encrypted unless physical seclevel is "
"LOW, which are in temp-*. Also, some plugins may create their own data "
"files, which may contain for instance messages you have posted or downloaded "
"from chat forums, and currently bookmarks and recently completed files are "
"stored in plain text. It is our intention to move these into node.db4o or "
"store them in separate encrypted databases, as soon as we have automatic "
"backups for node.db4o. See [here](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/"
"Program_files) for details on some of the files."

"### Mirrored installation\n"
"\n"
"If you have a working Freenet installation directory that you have mirrored "
"from one Unix machine to another (e.g. via rsync or unison), enabling the "
"mirrored installation is not difficult. Nothing in a Freenet installation "
"cares about its host's IP address; it can't, or Freenet would fail on "
"machines that get IP addressss from a DHCP pool\n"
"\n"
"All you actually need to do is tell the system you've mirrored to that it "
"should start the Freenet proxy daemon for you on boot. Do <tt>crontab -l</"
"tt> on the source machine, find the line that is tagged \"FREENET AUTOSTART"
"\" and add that to your crontab on the mirrored machine.\n"
"\n"
"However: each installation has a unique identity key generated at "
"installation time. If you try to run two instances with the same identity "
"_at the same time_, both proxy demons will become confused and upset. Don't "
"do this!\n"

"### Firewalls and routers\n"
"\n"
"Freenet should work fine with most routers, but if you are having problems "
"and you have a firewall or router, click [**here**](help.html#firewall) for "
"some info.\n"
"\n"
"### So it's running, what do I do?\n"
"\n"
"When the installer closes, it should open a browser window pointing to the "
"first-time wizard. Here you can configure basic settings, and then start "
"using Freenet. You can access Freenet later on via the system tray menu "
"(bottom right on the screen), or use the Browse Freenet shortcut on the "
"desktop and/or start menu. If it doesn't work, open [http://127.0.0.1:8888/]"
"(http://127.0.0.1:8888/) in your web browser.\n"
"\n"
"For best security you should use a separate browser for Freenet, preferably "
"in privacy mode. On Windows, the system tray menu will try to use Chrome in "
"incognito mode if possible. Internet Explorer does not work well with "
"Freenet, Firefox and Opera are widely used.\n"
"\n"
"If you know anyone running Freenet, you can improve your security and help "
"to build a robust network by connecting to their node. First, open the [Add "
"a friend page](http://127.0.0.1:8888/addfriend/). You and your friend should "
"each download their \"node reference\". Send the file to the other person, "
"and add his node reference using the form at the bottom of the page. When "
"both are added, your friend's node should show up on the Friends page, "
"probably as \"CONNECTED\" or \"BUSY\". You can set a name for your node on "
"the config page to make it easier to see who it is. Only add nodes run by "
"people **you actually know**, whether online or offline, as adding total "
"strangers harms performance and does not improve security much (they could "
"be the bad guys!).\n"
"\n"
"### So I'm connected, what do I do?\n"
"\n"
"Freenet itself includes anonymous websites (\"freesites\"), filesharing, "
"searching, and more, but you can also use third party applications for chat, "
"filesharing, to help you upload freesites, etc.\n"
"\n"
"The [Freenet Social Networking Guide](http://freesocial.draketo.de/) "
"explains how to set up the main third party tools, including email, forums "
"and micro-blogging (Sone, a bit like twitter).\n"
"\n"
"### It doesn't work, now what?\n"
"\n"
"If you have problems installing or running Freenet, please contact us on "
"[the support list](mailto:support@freenetproject.org) ([subscribe here](help."
"html#mailing-lists)), or join us on IRC on the #freenet channel on irc."
"freenode.net (try [here](https://webchat.freenode.net/?"
"randomnick=1&channels=freenet)).\n"
"\n"
"### Hardware requirements\n"
"\n"
"Generally a 1GHz processor and 1GB of RAM should be fine. Freenet will run "
"on smaller systems, but it uses at least 128MB of RAM, so unless the system "
"does nothing else it will struggle in less than 512MB. However, the "
"processor is less of a problem, people have been known to run it on 400MHz "
"Pentium 2's or ATOM's, although downloads and browsing would be slow.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet will use a portion of your disk for storing data, you can configure "
"this to any size from 100MB upwards, but we recommend at least 1GB. Freenet "
"also uses disk space for your downloads. Freenet's memory usage is "
"approximately 256MB plus 400kB for every 2GB of datastore.\n"
"\n"
"On 64-bit Windows, we will install a 32-bit Java Virtual Machine because of "
"limitations of the [Java Service Wrapper](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/"
"doc/english/download.jsp).\n"
"\n"
"### Upgrading\n"
"\n"
"Freenet provides an update-over-freenet mechanism: It will keep itself up to "
"date automatically from other Freenet nodes, and this will normally work "
"even if it is unable to route to them due to them being too new. This is "
"anonymous and secure, and we recommend people use it. However, if something "
"is severely broken, you can update your node manually from our servers:\n"
"\n"
"*   Windows users can upgrade to the latest-stable Freenet release from the "
"system tray menu, or by running \"update.cmd\" in the Freenet directory.\n"
"*   Mac and Linux users may upgrade by running the update.sh shell script in "
"the Freenet directory.\n"
"\n"
"**Source Code:** See [the developer page](contribute.html#developers) for "
"git access, or download the lastest stable tarball [here](https://github.com/"

"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"disclaimer\"></a>\n"
"### 1\\. A Disclaimer\n"
"\n"
"There are many reasons why people get involved in the Freenet Project. Some "
"share the views outlined in this document; some share variations of these "
"views, which are also served by what we are trying to achieve; and some just "
"enjoy the technical challenge. These are the ideas which motivated me to "
"architect the system in the first place, but not necessarily the views that "
"everyone involved in the Freenet project holds.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"prior_reading\"></a>\n"
"### 2\\. Suggested prior reading\n"
"\n"
"For this document to make sense, you should probably know what Freenet is. "
"You can get a good overview on the [What is Freenet?](index."
"html#introduction) page.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"free_flow_info\"></a>\n"
"### 3\\. The importance of the Free flow of information\n"
"\n"
"Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally considered to be "
"one of the most important rights any individual might have. Why is the "
"freedom to share ideas and opinions so important? There are several ways to "
"answer this question.\n"
"\n"
"#### 3.1 Communication is what makes us human\n"
"\n"
"One of the most obvious differences between mankind and the rest of the "
"animal kingdom is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract "
"concepts. While we constantly discover that animal's communication ability "
"is more sophisticated than previously assumed, it is unlikely that any other "
"animal approaches our own level of ability in this area.\n"
"\n"
"#### 3.2 Knowledge is good\n"
"\n"
"Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing "
"something, will choose to have more information rather than less. Wars have "
"been won and lost over who was better-informed. This is because being better-"
"informed allows us to make better decisions, and generally improve our "
"ability to survive and be successful.\n"
"\n"
"#### 3.3 Democracy assumes a well informed population\n"
"\n"
"Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who don't, "
"probably want to. Democracy is an answer to the question of how to create "
"leaders, while preventing them from abusing that power. It achieves this by "
"giving the population the power to regulate their government through voting, "
"yet the ability to vote does not necessarily mean that you live in a "
"democratic country. For a population to regulate their government "
"effectively it must know what their government is doing, they must be well "
"informed. It is a feedback loop, but this loop can be broken if the "
"government has the power to control the information the population has "
"access to.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"censor_freedom\"></a>\n"
"### 4\\. Censorship and freedom\n"
"\n"
"Everyone values their freedom, in fact, many consider it so important that "
"they will die for it. People like to think that they are free to form and "
"hold whatever opinions they like, particularly in western countries. "
"Consider now that someone had the ability to control the information you "
"have access to. This would give them the ability to manipulate your opinions "
"by hiding some facts from you, by presenting you with lies and censoring "
"anything that contradicted those lies. This is not some Orwellian fiction, "
"it is standard practice for most western governments to lie to their "
"populations, so much so, that people now take it for granted, despite the "
"fact that this undermines the very democratic principles which justify the "
"government's existence in the first place.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"solution\"></a>\n"
"### 5\\. The solution\n"
"\n"
"The only way to ensure that a democracy will remain effective is to ensure "
"that the government cannot control its population's ability to share "
"information, to communicate. So long as everything we see and hear is "
"filtered, we are not truly free. Freenet's aim is to allow two or more "
"people who wish to share information, to do so.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"is_censorship_necessary\"></a>\n"
"### 6\\. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?\n"
"\n"
"Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that "
"censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some "
"European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal. "
"Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed "
"damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is "
"that you can't allow those in power to impose \"good\" censorship, without "
"also enabling them to impose \"bad\" censorship. To impose any form of "
"censorship a government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict "
"communication. There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship "
"in many European countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of "
"events such as the second world war.\n"
"\n"
"The second argument is that this \"good\" censorship is counter-productive "
"even when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally "
"more effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them "
"with the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. "
"Unfortunately, preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated "
"arguments used by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when "
"they do eventually encounter them.\n"
"\n"
"Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true "
"even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship, "
"or you don't. There is no middle-ground.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"why_anonymity\"></a>\n"
"### 7\\. But why is anonymity necessary?\n"
"\n"
"You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous. "
"Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail "
"free speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than "
"preventing them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent "
"this is to remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot "
"trust anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital "
"signatures people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, "
"people can learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called "
"\"subspaces\" to facilitate this.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"copyright\"></a>\n"
"### 8\\. And what of copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of "
"copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with "
"copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications, "
"and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything "
"you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point "
"when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:\n"
"\n"
"<center>You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law</"
"center>\n"
"\n"
"It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of "
"Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"reward\"></a>\n"
"### 9\\. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded "
"for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than "
"having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do "
"not understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion, "
"the only question is whether they can do it for a living).\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. "
"The music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in "
"communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be "
"rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed middle-"
"men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the detriment of "
"both artists and the public.\n"
"\n"
"<a class=\"anchor\" name=\"alternative\"></a>\n"
"### 10\\. Alternatives to Copyright\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to reward "
"artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension of the "
"patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists prior to "
"copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to allow them to "
"create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting extension of this "
"idea, where rather than having just one wealthy patron, you could have "
"hundreds of thousands, contributing small amounts of money over the "
"Internet.\n"
"\n"
"We actually practice what we preach in this regard too, on the 15th of March "
"2001 the Freenet Project started taking donations, and within a week we had "
"collected over $1000\\."

"Developers of the privacy-focused Debian derivative Mempo report that it can "

"\n"
"Key Points:\n"
"\n"
"*   use Freenet to distribute online updates\n"
"*   most secure hosting option\n"
"\n"
"That means it is now possible to get reproducibly built kernels checked by "
"anonymous (and therefore hard to pressure) contributors and update them over "
"Freenet without disclosing that you use them. This applies to the packages "
"provided by Mempo - other apt-get activity like installing GIMP is still "
"public. It would be possible to host the entire Debian repository in "
"Freenet, but this is not yet on the agenda for Mempo because this other "
"activity does not disclose the potentially sensitive information that you "
"want additional privacy.\n"
"\n"
"> The practical cool result now, is that Mempo repository can not be "
"censored, DDoSed or taken offline, despite having just 1 tiny server (or no "
"server at all) - rfreeman (one of the mempo developers)"

"This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to "
"support Java 6\\. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless "
"running on Java 7 or later. Support for this behavior is part of a larger "
"effort to allow separate official update channels - stable, testing, and "
"unstable - as well as make it easier to publish unofficial update channels "
"and further improve deployment security.\n"
"\n"
"Highlights for this build:\n"
"\n"
"*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow "
"hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive "
"annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)</a>\n"
"*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade "
"code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop](https://bugs."
"freenetproject.org/view.php?id=3208).\n"
"*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind "
"it](https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/286) and will change when network "
"parameters are adjusted.\n"
"*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!\n"
"*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will "
"reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to "
"spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally Matthew's (toad_'s) summer work on a custom on-disk format is "
"done. This release lays the groundwork to include the results of that work "
"[in the next release](http://127.0.0.1:8888/USK@pxtehd-"

"LTjcTWqvsq3ju6pMGe9Cqb3scvQgECG81hRdgj5WO4s,AQACAAE/blog/23/Content-626611C."
"html). This is designed for less disk activity and better behavior when "
"corrupted.\n"
"\n"
"This release coincides with the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the "
"Berlin wall (Mauerfall), which marked the beginning of the end of a large "
"censorship and surveillance regime. May censorship be demolished "
"everywhere!\n"

"This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor "
"hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single "
"server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut "
"down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on "
"the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/"
"blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list]"

"html).\n"
"\n"
"On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across "
"thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available "
"for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed "
"data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and "
"be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet "
"and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq."
"html#tor).\n"
"\n"
"Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet "
"because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an "
"option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use "
"Tor.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no "
"users of the major \"darknets\" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by "
"attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it "
"appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on "
"Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you "
"are about to do something risky.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some "
"known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker "
"with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. "
"Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived "
"connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend "
"\"darknet\". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet "
"software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to "
"improve anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security "
"(censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and "
"usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. "
"PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR "
"and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.\n"
"\n"
"Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to "
"the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a "
"node or creating content (anonymously)!\n"
"\n"
"Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to "
"contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists]"
"(help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the \"freenet\" board on "

"Long time coder xor (also known as p0s) has agreed to work, in a paid role, "

"many Freenet plugins:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Sone**, an anonymous social network / microblogging tool.\n"
"*   **Freemail**, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.\n"
"*   A filesharing system as yet unnamed which a student is working on.\n"
"*   Extensions to Infocalypse, being worked on by another student, a tool "
"for managing source code which is vital to developing software over "
"Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"See the Freenet Social Networking Guide for how to load the first 2 "
"plugins.\n"
"\n"
"xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in "
"the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and "
"performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further "
"optimisations are planned.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet relies on unpaid volunteer developers as well as a few key paid "
"developers. Toad (Matthew Toseland) is returning to full time work for "
"Freenet after a study break, although he is off to university in October, "
"and xor is just starting working for Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"Improving the Web of Trust should substantially improve the performance of "
"the key tools mentioned above and may be used by more in the future. Thanks "

"**by [Ian Clarke](mailto:ian@locut.us), Freenet Project Coordinator, 20th "
"July 2003**\n"
"\n"
"While Freenet has come a long way since my 1999 paper, the fundamental ideas "
"behind how Freenet finds information have changed very little. Now that "
"Freenet is maturing it is time to re-examine the core Freenet architecture "
"to see where it can be improved. This new design is known as \"Next "
"Generation Routing\".\n"
"\n"
"### Freenet's current routing mechanism\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, let me recap on how Freenet works right now. Every node in the "
"Freenet network is required to provide a simple service to other nodes in "
"the system. When a node receives a request for a particular key, it should "
"do its best to retrieve the data corresponding to that key as quickly as "
"possible and send it back to the node that requested it. Provided that every "
"node in the Freenet network performs this service reasonably well - Freenet "
"will work.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest case, the recipients of the request will already have the "
"data cached locally, and can immediately send it to the requester. In most "
"cases, however, the node will need to request the data from another node in "
"the network which it thinks will be better able to retrieve the data. The "
"way Freenet makes this decision forms the core of the Freenet algorithm.\n"
"\n"
"At present, the algorithm used to select which node should be consulted for "
"a given key is relatively simple. In short, when a node forwards a request "
"for a particular key to another node in the network, and that node is "
"successful in retrieving the data, the address of an upstream node (possibly "
"the one where the data originated) is included in the reply, this is called "
"the \"DataSource\". The requester makes a note of the requested key, and the "
"DataSource node passed back with that reply. It is assumed that the upstream "
"node is a good place to route future requests for keys closest to the "
"previously requested key. It is analogous to deciding that since your friend "
"George successfully answered a question about France, he might also be a "
"good person to answer a question about Belgium.\n"
"\n"
"Despite its simplicity, this approach has proved surprisingly effective, "
"both in simulation and in practice. One of the expected side effects of this "
"approach was that nodes would tend to specialize in the retrieval of some "
"keys to the exclusion of others. This can be seen is somewhat analogous to "
"the way that people specialize in particular areas of expertise. This effect "
"has been observed in actual Freenet nodes deployed in the Freenet network, "
"the following image represents the keys stored by an actual Freenet node. "
"The X axis represents the \"keyspace\", at the left is key 0, across to the "
"right which is key 2<sup>160</sup>. Dark areas indicate where the node has "
"better knowledge. The dark strips indicate areas in which the node has "
"detailed knowledge about where requests for those keys should be routed:\n"
"\n"
"<center>* image rthist.png missing, let us know if you find it! *</center>\n"
"\n"
"Note that when the node was first initialized keys would have been evenly "
"distributed across the keyspace. This is a good indication that Freenet's "
"current routing algorithm is performing correctly. Nodes specialize like "
"this due to an emergent feedback effect, when a node successfully responds "
"to a request for a given key - it increases the likelihood that other nodes "
"will route requests for similar keys in the future. Over time this effect "
"causes the specialization that can be seen very clearly in the diagram "
"above. You can see an animation of a node's datastore specializing over time "
"[here](assets/img/histanim.mpeg).\n"
"\n"
"### Next generation routing mechanism\n"
"\n"
"The fact that it works, of course, does not mean that it cannot be improved "
"upon. At the simplest level, note that the current algorithm does not "
"distinguish between a slow Freenet node sitting at the end of a slow modem "
"line in the remote Australian outback, and a powerful node connected to a T3 "
"in downtown Los Angeles. Also note that while the current algorithm works, "
"the only real way to test improvements to the algorithm is to see how they "
"affect a large scale network, either in simulation, or in the real world - "
"this leads to a slow and cumbersome development cycle. By making more "
"effective use of the information available to a Freenet node, we can "
"dramatically improve a node's ability to route requests in a manner likely "
"to result in the fastest response for that request. By avoiding guesswork, "
"and striving for a firm basis in statistical reality - we can even "
"accelerate our development effort by allowing ourselves to determine the "
"effectiveness of a modification based on its effect on a single node, before "
"we deploy it. These goals are achieved by Next Generation Routing.\n"
"\n"
"The core idea behind the Next Generation Routing design is to make Freenet "
"nodes much smarter about deciding where to route information. For each node "
"reference in its routing table, a node will collect extensive statistical "
"information including response times for requesting particular keys, the "
"proportion of requests which succeed in finding information, and the time "
"required to establish a connection in the first place. When a new request is "
"received, this information is used to estimate which node is likely to be "
"able to retrieve the data in the least amount of time, and that is the node "
"to which the request is forwarded.\n"
"\n"
"### DataReply estimation\n"
"\n"
"The most important metric is finding a way to estimate, given a given key "
"being requested from a given node, how long it will take to get the data. To "
"achieve this an algorithm was required that would meet the following "
"criteria:\n"
"\n"
"*   Must be able to make reasonable guesses about keys that it has not seen "
"before\n"
"\n"
"*   Must be progressive – if a node's performance changes over time, this "
"should be represented, but should not be oversensitive to recent "
"fluctuations which may vary significantly from the average.\n"
"\n"
"*   Must be “scale free”  \n"
"Consider a naive implementation of this that works by splitting the "
"keyspace into a number of sections and maintaining an average for each. Now "
"consider a node where most of its incoming requests lie within a very small "
"section of the keyspace. Our naïve implementation would be unable to "
"represent variations in response time within that small area and would "
"therefore limit that node's ability to accurately estimate routing times.\n"
"\n"
"*   Must be efficiently serializable\n"
"\n"
"We developed a simple algorithm which meets these criteria. It works by "
"maintaining N “reference” points (where N is configurable – 10 being a "
"typical value) which are initially evenly distributed across the keyspace. "
"When we have a new routing time sample for a particular key – we move the "
"two points closest to our new sample toward it. The amount they are moved "
"can be adjusted to change how “forgetful” the estimator is.\n"
"\n"
"<center>![](assets/img/rte_diag.gif)  \n"
"\n"
"</center>\n"
"\n"
"In this diagram it can be seen that two of the reference points (blue) are "
"being moved toward our new data sample (red).\n"
"\n"
"When we wish to create an estimate for a new key, we see where the line "
"between the reference points at either side of that key intersects (green) "
"and this gives us our estimated response time.\n"
"\n"
"### Handling different data lengths\n"
"\n"
"Also consider the fact that there isn't just one timing measurement that "
"must be taken into account when we receive a DataReply, there are two. The "
"first is the time required to get the beginning of the response, the second "
"is the time required to transfer the data. This raises the question of how "
"we can combine these two timings into a single value which can be reported "
"to the estimator algorithm described above.\n"
"\n"
"The answer we have settled upon is to use these two numbers to estimate what "
"the total time between the request being sent and the transfer being "
"_completed_ would have been had the data been the average length of data in "
"Freenet (which we in turn estimate by taking the average length of data in "
"the local datastore). This is a single value which can be compared directly "
"with other timing measurements even when they were made with requests where "
"the data was differing sizes.\n"
"\n"
"### Handling DataNotFound messages\n"
"\n"
"When a request has visited the number of nodes specified in its \"hops to "
"live\" field (similar to \"time to live\" in other protocols), a "
"\"DataNotFound\" or DNF message is returned to the requester. This indicates "
"that the data could not be found within the time limit specified by the "
"requester. There are two reasons that a DNF can be returned for some data, "
"either the data exists but wasn't found, or the data didn't exist at all. In "
"the former case, a DNF would indicate a shortcoming in the routing ability "
"of whichever node the request was routed to. In the latter case, it would "
"not - but the difficulty is that for a given DNF - there is no easy way to "
"tell what type of DNF it is, whether it is \"legitimate\" or not.\n"
"\n"
"Let, us, for a moment, assume that there was a way to identify illegitimate "
"DNFs. In this case, the cost in terms of the time required for such a DNF "
"would be the time required to receive the DNF plus the time required to "
"request the same data from somewhere else. We can estimate the former by "
"looking at how long previous DNFs took for requests sent to this node "
"(taking into account that this time will be proportional to the HTL of the "
"request <sup>ie.</sup> a request with a HTL of 10 will visit twice as many "
"nodes as a request with HTL 5 and will therefore take about twice as long to "
"return a DNF). We can estimate the latter by looking at the average amount "
"of time it takes to successfully retrieve some data.\n"
"\n"
"Now, imagine a Freenet node with perfect routing, the only DNFs it returns "
"would be \"legitimate\" - since if the data was in the network, it would "
"find it. The proportion of DNFs this perfect node returned would be the same "
"as the proportion of DNFs for which the data simply didn't exist in the "
"network. Now - such a node (we assume) could not exist, however we can "
"approximate it by looking at the proportion of DNFs for the node with the "
"lowest proportion of DNFs in our routing table.\n"
"\n"
"So now, we can determine the time cost of DNFs, and we can also approximate "
"what proportion of a node's DNFs are legitimate - and therefore should not "
"incur a time cost. We can therefore add an estimated routing time cost for "
"each node to account for DNFs.\n"
"\n"
"### Handing failed connections\n"
"\n"
"With nodes which are heavily overloaded - it is also possible that when we "
"attempt to establish a connection to them - we will be unable to do-so, we "
"can account for this possibility by recalling the average proportion of "
"failed connections for each node, and how long each took - and adding this "
"on to our estimated routing time for that node.\n"
"\n"
"### Inherited Knowledge\n"
"\n"
"One of the problems observed in the current Freenet is the time required for "
"a Freenet node to establish sufficient knowledge about the Freenet network "
"to route efficiently. This is particularly damaging to Freenet's usability "
"as people's first impressions of software is critical, and the first "
"impressions of Freenet are generally the worst impressions of Freenet as "
"they are formed before the Freenet node can route requests effectively.\n"
"\n"
"The solution is to employ some qualified trust between Freenet nodes, "
"allowing them to share the information the have collected about each other, "
"albeit in a rather untrusting way. There are two ways that a Freenet node "
"finds out about new Freenet nodes. The first is when they first start up - "
"they load a \"seednodes.ref\" file which contains the routing expertise of "
"another experienced node. With N.G routing this information will be enriched "
"with actual statistical data so that even with a node first starts up, it "
"will already have the knowledge of an experienced node. It will then go on "
"to refine this knowledge according to its own experience.\n"
"\n"
"The other way nodes learn about new nodes is in the \"DataSource\" field of "
"successful replies to requests for data. The DataSource field will contain "
"one of the upstream nodes in the request chain. The simple approach would be "
"to allow this DataSource node to attach statistical information concerning "
"its own performance to the reply - but clearly this would be open to abuse. "
"A refinement would be to say that any node passing back a reply which has "
"collected its own statistical information about the node in the DataSource "
"will replace the statistical data in the reply with its own. This will mean "
"that even if a node does put misleading statistical information in the reply "
"- it will probably be replaced as it is passed back to the requester.\n"
"\n"
"### Benefits of Next-Generation Routing\n"
"\n"
"*   **Adapts to network topology**  \n"
"In the old Freenet routing algorithm, a Freenet node running on a slow "
"modem in the middle of the Australian outback is viewed pretty much the same "
"way as a fast node running on a T3 in downtown San Jose. In essence, the "
"underlying Internet topology is ignored by Freenet, all nodes are treated "
"equally. In contrast, N.G routing bases its decisions on actual routing "
"times, this means that a node will tend to prefer routing messages to faster "
"nodes, on better Internet connections that are geographically closer - "
"unless those nodes become overloaded, which will decrease the incentive to "
"use them and have a load balancing effect.\n"
"*   **Performance can be evaluated locally**  \n"
"With the old approach to Freenet's routing, the only concrete way to "
"evaluate its performance was by trying it. With N.G Routing we have a simple "
"metric of how effectively it is performing - namely the difference between "
"estimated routing times, and actual routing times. If a modification to the "
"algorithm results in closer estimates, then we know it is better. If not, we "
"know that it isn't. This will dramatically accelerate the development cycle "
"of future improvements.\n"
"*   **Approaching optimality**  \n"
"If one accepts that in an environment where only one's own node may be "
"trusted, it is reasonable to say that all decisions should be based upon "
"one's own observations. Given this, it could be said that if we make optimal "
"use of prior observations while making routing decisions, then our routing "
"algorithm is optimal. Now clearly there will always be room for refinement "
"in the manner in which the new algorithm estimates routing times\n"
"\n"
"### Current Status\n"
"\n"
"Next Generation routing was deployed in Freenet from 2003-2005, however in "
"Freenet 0.7, started in 2005, we reverted back to a much simpler approach. A "
"2007 paper by Oskar Sandberg [Decentralized Search with Random Costs](http://"
"arxiv.org/abs/0804.0577) determined that the concepts underlying this paper "
"\"were fundamentally sound\".\n"

"> _\"I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though she's "
"too young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 "
"or 15 years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy, where were you "
"when they took freedom of the press away from the Internet?'\"_   \n"

"\n"
"Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and "
"publish \"freesites\" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat "
"on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it "
"less vulnerable to attack, and if used in \"darknet\" mode, where users only "
"connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect.\n"
"\n"
"Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are routed through other "
"nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the "
"information and what its content is.\n"
"\n"
"Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their "
"hard drive (called the \"data store\") for storing files. Files are "
"automatically kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the "
"least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content. "
"Files are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in "
"his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it. Chat forums, "
"websites, and search functionality, are all built on top of this distributed "
"data store.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet has been downloaded over 2 million times since the project started, "
"and used for the distribution of censored information all over the world "
"including countries such as China and the Middle East. Ideas and concepts "
"pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the academic world. "
"Our 2000 paper \"Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and "
"Retrieval System\" was the most cited computer science paper of 2000 "
"according to Citeseer, and Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of "
"law and philosophy. Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator, "
"was selected as one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology "
"Review magazine.\n"
"\n"
"An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the "
"\"darknet\": By only connecting to people they trust, users can greatly "
"reduce their vulnerability, and yet still connect to a global network "
"through their friends' friends' friends and so on. This enables people to "
"use Freenet even in places where Freenet may be illegal, makes it very "
"difficult for governments to block it, and does not rely on tunneling to the "
"\"free world\".\n"

"We are using [git](http://git-scm.com/) as our source code management "
"system, hosted on [github](https://github.com/). We have many different git "
"repositories for the website, freenet itself (fred), official plugins, the "
"two installers, libraries and so on; for the list, see [our page on github]"
"(https://github.com/freenet/).\n"
"\n"
"We strongly recommend that you use the official command-line git client, or "
"the Windows port. If you want to use the Eclipse git integration, see the "
"tutorial [here](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide).\n"
"\n"
"You can obtain the latest source code from git using the following command "
"line:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit clone git://github.com/freenet/fred.git</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Once you have cloned the repository, to get new changes you should do:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit pull origin</pre>\n"
"\n"
"More information on how to use git is further down this page.\n"
"\n"
"Git is a distributed revision control system, this means amongst other "
"things:\n"
"\n"
"*   Everyone has a full copy of the repository, including all the history.\n"
"*   Branching and merging is easy.\n"
"*   Working offline (e.g. on a train) is easy.\n"
"*   We are much less vulnerable to compromise or failure of a central "
"server.\n"
"*   Anonymous contribution over Freenet is much easier.\n"
"*   Generally a more secure workflow.\n"
"\n"
"Initially we used git in a manner similar to SVN: Every developer has the "
"right to push to the repository, and we gave out push rights fairly "
"liberally. However, this is probably not the best model: Many other projects "
"using Git use a more centralised (or decentralised, depending on how you "
"look at it) model where you fork the repository (this is really easy on "
"github), make your changes, push them to your repository, and then ask us to "
"pull them; then a core developer reviews the changes and either pulls them "
"into the main repository or asks for further changes. The advantage is there "
"are fewer reverts in the history, better code in general, stuff can be put "
"off more easily when we are trying to get a release out, and the security "
"model is simpler. We are trying to mode to this model at the moment. You may "
"find it is easier to fork -staging and then post a pull request (github "
"makes both of these things easy), rather than asking for push rights to -"
"staging.\n"
"\n"
"Each part of Freenet currently has two repositories: -official and -staging "
"(e.g. fred-official and fred-staging). This is left over from our using git "
"similarly to SVN: The -official repository has been reviewed and released at "
"least as a pre-build, and only core devs can push to it - they must review "
"the code they are pushing before doing so, and will usually sign a tag for "
"the build or pre-build after doing so. The -staging repository almost anyone "
"can write to. New developers should fork on github and then post pull "
"requests.\n"
"\n"
"### Branches\n"
"\n"
"The \"master\" branch tracks the latest release. The \"next\" branch "
"includes code that should be in the next release, but may or may not be at "
"the discretion of the release manager. Any significant feature should have "
"its own branch. Release branches e.g. \"stable-1411\" are used by the "
"release manager from time to time.\n"
"\n"
"### Build Instructions\n"
"\n"
"To build the source code you will need [Apache ANT](http://ant.apache."
"org/).\n"
"\n"
"### Full Build\n"
"\n"
"Building Fred (the Freenet reference daemon) with ant will pull in freenet-"
"ext.jar for third party dependancies from the website. To build freenet-ext."
"jar yourself you need to get the contrib module, build it, and put it into "
"lib/freenet-ext.jar before you build the main project. Note also that the "
"contrib module contains a number of native libraries used to improve "
"performance; you may also want to rebuild these.\n"
"\n"
"Plugins, installers etc can generally be built with ant, but some libraries "
"may be written in other languages and have their own building procedures.\n"
"\n"
"### Basic git workflow\n"
"\n"
"To pull all changes to the repository:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit pull origin</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Or if you want to review the changes before you merge them into your local "
"repository:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit fetch origin\n"
"\tgit log -p -M --ignore-space-change master..origin/master</pre>\n"
"\n"
"If you are happy with the changes, then either merge your local changes into "
"the remote changes:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit rebase origin/master</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Or merge the remote changes into your local repository:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit merge origin/master</pre>\n"
"\n"
"The latter will result in a non-linear history, so you should use rebase "
"unless your local changes are very large.\n"
"\n"
"To commit your local changes to your local repository:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit commit -a</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Or:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit commit [ filenames you want to commit ]</pre>\n"
"\n"
"To upload your changes:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit push origin</pre>\n"
"\n"
"To view recent changes:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit log -p -M --ignore-space-change</pre>\n"
"\n"
"To undo one or more local commits, assuming you have not pushed your "
"changes, and have not merged remote changes (this will simply reset your "
"local repository to a previous version, getting rid of everything since "
"then):\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit reset [ last good revision ]</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Or if you have committed your change, you will need to revert it:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tgit revert [ revision to get rid of ]</pre>\n"
"\n"
"More documentation for git can be found [here](http://git-scm.com/"
"documentation) or [here](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/).\n"
"\n"
"### Review\n"
"\n"
"If you don't like a commit, or think it could be improved, generally you "
"should post to the devl [mailing list](help.html#mailing-lists). You should "
"CC the author of the commit, but unless it is a trivial matter you should "
"always mail devl.\n"
"\n"
"### Development guidelines\n"
"\n"
"Please keep us informed of what you are doing with Freenet! Create a github "
"account, and then contact us either through the [development mailing list]"
"(https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devl) or on [IRC]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) in the [#freenet](irc://"
"irc.freenode.net/%23freenet) channel at irc.freenode.net. Note that it is "
"very useful to be able to contact contributors, so you should use a real "
"(working) email address (we will provide an @freenetproject.org redirect if "
"you need one), or see the section on contributing through Freenet below.\n"
"\n"
"Project coding standards are documented [here](https://wiki.freenetproject."
"org/Coding_standards). Commits which do not follow these standards are "
"likely to be rejected.\n"
"\n"
"We strongly discourage \"dropping a bomb\", that is, sending in a huge patch "
"with no history. This can be both harder to understand and risky legally "
"(think SCO vs IBM). For large projects, you should post a git branch, on "
"github or on Freenet, so we can merge and keep the history. Of course you "
"can clean up the history before posting a pull request if you want. What is "
"more important is to let us know early on so we can help you to get it "
"right.\n"
"\n"
"All releases are reviewed manually both to ensure security and to avoid "
"bugs, and this is much easier if you follow some basic rules:\n"
"\n"
"*   Keep cosmetic changes separate from functional changes. In particular, "
"indenting and braces improvements, while these are generally acceptable, "
"should **not** be mixed with functional changes.\n"
"*   Don't break the build: When you push, fred should build. Ideally each "
"individual commit should build.\n"
"*   Small commits: \"git commit\" is a purely local operation, so there is "
"no reason to combine a bunch of unrelated changes in a single commit. "
"Obviously use your judgement.\n"
"*   Big or controversial stuff should go on a branch, rather than just "
"getting pushed. We may be in the process of getting a new build out, and if "
"big stuff is pushed it is likely to be shifted to a branch while the build "
"is deployed.\n"
"\n"
"### Development over Freenet\n"
"\n"
"We accept patches submitted over Freenet via FMS. However, we will still "
"need some sort of identity, e.g. a nick and a Freemail (v2) address. There "
"are implementations of both Git and Mercurial (which can be bridged to git) "
"over Freenet, although we don't currently maintain an official in-freenet "
"tree.\n"
"\n"
"### The website\n"
"\n"
"To edit the website, fork the website repository, edit the files (in pages/"
"en/), commit and push as above. Then post a pull request and remind "
"administrators to deploy it if isn't done in reasonable time.\n"
"\n"
"The website is php-based but is compiled at deploy time into static HTML. "
"You can simulate this to see exactly what your changes will look like by "
"running the make-pages.sh script (you will need php5-cgi). This outputs "
"static HTML to output/.\n"
"\n"
"We are trying to move most of the documentation to [the wiki](https://wiki."
"freenetproject.org), which should be easier to edit."

"To install Freenet might not be as difficult as you might have heard. There "
"are two ways to install Freenet:\n"
"\n"
"*   Graphical install\n"
"*   Headless install\n"
"*   Enabling a mirror copy of a Freenet installation\n"
"\n"
"If you want to install the Freenet software on a computer which lacks a GUI, "
"see the [Headless install](download.html#unix) instructions. If you have "
"mirrored a working Freenet installation to a machine without explicitly "
"installing it, see [Mirrored install](download.html#mirrored). Otherwise, "
"continue reading.\n"
"\n"
"#### Graphical install\n"
"\n"
"**The below is outdated for Windows systems**, for Windows you should use "
"[the Windows installer](assets/jnlp/FreenetInstaller.exe) as described on "
"[the download page](download.html). You can also get the Windows installer "
"from [here](https://downloads.freenetproject.org/latest/FreenetInstaller."
"exe).\n"
"\n"
"For a graphical installation you have to have:\n"
"\n"
"*   A working Java Runtime Environment,\n"
"*   a downloaded copy of [new_installer_offline.jar](assets/jnlp/"
"freenet_installer.jar) (if this does not work try [here](https://downloads."
"freenetproject.org/latest/new_installer_offline.jar))\n"
"*   a working graphical user interface (GUI)\n"
"\n"
"You should save the new_installer.jar file somewhere were you can find it "
"again. Your home-directory should be a good place. The next step requires "
"you to know where you stored the file (the path to it), so it is quite "
"important that you do that step thouroghly.\n"
"\n"
"To start the installation, open a command line interface/terminal/shell "
"window. Exchange the **/path/to** to the real path (for example: /home/"
"username/download/new_installer.jar) to the new_installer.jar-file and "
"type:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\t$ java -jar /path/to/new_installer_offline.jar</pre>\n"
"\n"
"The first window you should see is the one below, which allows you to select "
"your preferred language for the installation program.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/install/1-langselect.png)\n"
"\n"
"Next is shown an about-box, some information about the version of Freenet "
"and authors. Just click **Next** to proceed.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/install/2-about.png)\n"
"\n"
"The next step is to choose the directory in which to install Freenet. The "
"default location on Linux operating systems is **/home/username/Freenet** as "
"shown below. Change it to something appropriate or leave \"as is\". Click "
"**Next** when you are finished.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/install/4-Install_directory.png)\n"
"\n"
"Select the packages that you want to install with your Freenet software. "
"Since it takes up virtually no extra disk-space, it is recommended that you "
"leave all packages selected and press **Next**.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/install/5-select_packages.png)\n"
"\n"
"In the next stage, the packages are installed, and a progress meter runs "
"across the window. When it is finished, press **Next** to continue to the "
"next step.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/install/6-Install_packages.png)\n"
"\n"
"After that, the Freenet software is installed and/or upgraded, plugins are "
"enabled and the environment is started. When completed, press **Next** to "
"proceed.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/install/7-install_progress.png)\n"
"\n"
"For some graphical environments, shortcuts in the menu-structure can be "
"created. This is not the case for all of the platforms that Freenet run on. "
"However, there should be created shortcuts on the desktop in all supported "
"environments. Change the application group according to your needs and press "
"**Next** when finished.\n"

"If all has gone well, a browser window should have opened in the background. "
"This will ask you a bunch of questions to configure Freenet, and then you "
"should be able to use it.\n"
"\n"
"It will ask about network security level - \"protection from strangers "
"attacking you over the internet\". If you choose LOW or NORMAL, Freenet "
"should \"just work\", connecting in a few minutes. If you choose HIGH or "
"MAXIMUM, Freenet will need you to add Friends before you can use it. These "
"must be people you personally know. Adding people you don't know will not "

"There are two ways to connect to Freenet:\n"
"\n"
"*   You can enable insecure mode (the installation wizard will ask you) and "
"Freenet will automatically find nodes to connect to - Strangers.\n"
"*   You can connect to nodes run by people you know - Friends. Note that "
"these should be people you actually know on some level, in order to maintain "
"good network topology and maximum security.\n"
"\n"
"In practice, you should probably use both of these options, unless you are "
"really paranoid, in which case you should of course only connect to people "
"you trust. Insecure mode should work automatically once enabled, so the rest "
"of this page is about connecting to Friends.\n"
"\n"
"To connect to your friends' nodes, you have to exchange Node references with "
"them. The references must be added on **both sides** to be established. That "
"is, you need to add his/hers, and he/she needs to add yours.\n"
"\n"
"*When you have a freshly connected node, you have no data cached in your "
"datastore, and very few connections even if insecure mode is enabled. "
"Requests are sent out in a random fashion. **This makes some (or all) "
"requests time out before retrieving anything.** It takes a couple of days "
"for your Freenet-node to get up to speed, so please don't get discouraged by "
"this.*\n"
"\n"
"You should have at least three nodes that are connected to you at all times, "
"ideally at least five to seven. Since some nodes may be unreachable at "
"times, you need to connect to some more nodes to get the expected number. "
"The nodes that are connected directly to you are the only nodes on freenet "
"that might see what kind of traffic that passes through to your Freenet "
"node. But if insecure mode is enabled, any node can find yours; this is the "
"big advantage of **not** enabling insecure mode: you are effectively "
"invisible except to your Friends. In practice most people start off with "
"insecure mode and gradually add Friends, and hopefully turn off insecure "
"mode once they have at least 10 Friends.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/Freenet-architecture-small.png)\n"
"\n"
"*Figure 1: Visible Freenet connections*\n"
"\n"
"**Node A** in the figure also has a number of nodes connected to it, but "
"they are all (except from your own node) invisible to you. The traffic "
"routing algorithm is therefore only able to direct traffic to one of the few "
"nodes that you know of that it thinks is most able to find what you are "
"looking for.\n"
"\n"
"The traffic is encrypted, so it is quite difficult for the nodes that you "
"connect to to see what your Freenet-traffic consists of, but it is far from "
"impossible. It is therefore important that you connect only to people you "
"know. If that is not possible, then at least people you've talked to.\n"
"\n"
"There are a number of ways to add peer node references.\n"
"\n"
"### Fproxy\n"
"\n"
"Connecting peer nodes with FProxy can be done in several ways. Common for "
"all these are that they are all done under the **Darknet** menu item or "
"using the [http://127.0.0.1:8888/friends/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/friends/) "
"link. Below is the thing that makes it all happen:\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/add_peers.png)\n"
"\n"
"As you can see, there are three ways of getting a node reference from "
"someone else:\n"
"\n"
"*   Pasting it \"as is\", in the top field,\n"
"*   a URL pointing at the reference, or\n"
"*   a file, containing the reference.\n"
"\n"
"[http://dark-code.bulix.org/](http://dark-code.bulix.org/) is a so called "
"**paste-bin**, where you can add your node reference, make sure that the "
"**private** box is checked, and press **Paste**.\n"
"\n"
"The paste-bin then returns an URL (e.g. http://dark-code.bulix.org/"
"yuf01h-34676?raw), which can be shared with others. Make sure that you add "
"**?raw** to the link. This makes the link point only to the actual pasted "
"data, with no extra design elements.\n"
"\n"
"Your own Freenet reference can be found on the [http://127.0.0.1:8888/"

"In addition to its anonymity features, Freenet is also an effective way to "
"distribute large files - often achieving download speeds faster than other "
"content distribution systems. As a content distribution network Freenet has "
"the following advantages:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Totally decentralized**  \n"
"Information can be inserted into Freenet for download without any "
"reliance on a centralized server. All the inserter needs to do is give the "
"content's \"key\" to someone else and they will be able to download it.\n"
"*   **Adaptive caching**  \n"
"Many CDN architectures only allow peers which have already downloaded a "
"file to share it with other peers. Freenet will adaptively cache information "
"on peers as necessary to meet demand regardless of what that peer has "
"downloaded. This allows Freenet to \"scale-up\" much more quickly than most "
"solutions for popular files, and improves load-balancing.\n"
"*   **Strong Security**  \n"
"Freenet has long-supported the concept of \"Content Hash Keys\" which "
"guarantee the integrity of retrieved data. This approach has since been "
"adopted by other architectures. Freenet also supports \"Signed Subspace Keys"
"\" which allow content to be digitally signed. This also allows content "
"integrity to be guaranteed, but is more flexible than CHKs.\n"
"*   **Forward Error Correction**  \n"
"In-common with some other CDN architectures, Freenet employs \"Forward "
"Error Correction\", which allows files to be reconstructed even if some of "
"the parts of that file can't be retrieved. Uniquely, Freenet also supports "
"\"healing\", which involves the reconstruction and reinsertion of missing "
"file components.\n"
"\n"
"This page contains links to freely available content on Freenet. If you "
"would like to add a new link please email it to [us](mailto:ian@locut.us) - "
"remember that we will only link to content that can be legally distributed "

"Freenet can be thought of as a large storage device. When you store a file "
"in it, you receive a key which can be used to retrieve the file. When you "
"supply Freenet with a key, it returns the appropriate file (if it is "
"located). The storage space is distributed among all connected nodes on "
"Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet is a Peer-to-peer network, which is both decentralized and "
"anonymized. The nodes that you connect to only knows its nearest neighbours "
"and has no idea about how the network as a whole is structured.\n"
"\n"
"### Small world network\n"
"\n"
"Freenet is built on the principle of small world networks. By connecting to "
"nodes of people you already know, and the people you know in turn connect to "
"people they know, one should be able to reach all nodes in a Freenet "
"network.\n"
"\n"
"### The datastore\n"
"\n"
"All Freenet nodes contribute with a part of their harddrive space to store "
"files. The files are stored encrypted in the **store**-directory in the "
"Freenet installation directory.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike other peer-to-peer networks, you as a user have little or no control "
"over what is stored in your datastore. Instead, files are kept or deleted "
"depending on how popular they are. This is to ensure that Freenet is "
"censorship resistant. The only possible way to remove something from Freenet "
"is to not search for it, and hope that everybody else does the same.\n"
"\n"
"It is hard, but not impossible, to determine which files that are stored in "
"your local Freenet Datastore. This is to enable plausible deniability as to "
"what kind of material that lies on your harddrive in the datastore.\n"
"\n"
"The initial diskspace allocated for the datastore is 5%% of available disk "
"space if it is over 20GB, 10%% if it is over 10GB, 512MB if under 10GB, and "
"256MB if under 5GB. You can change the store size at any time, the more the "
"better, both for your personal browsing and for Freenet as a whole.\n"
"\n"
"### Freenet Routing\n"
"\n"
"Initially, each node has no information about the performance of the other "
"nodes it knows about. This means that routing of requests is essentially "
"random. But since different nodes have different randomness, they will "
"disagree about where to send a request, given a key. So the data in a newly-"
"started Freenet will be distributed somewhat randomly.\n"
"\n"
"As more documents are inserted by the same node, they will begin to cluster "
"with data items whose keys (see below) are similar, because the same routing "
"rules are used for all of them. More importantly, as data items and requests "
"from different nodes \"cross paths\", they will begin to share clustering "
"information as well.\n"
"\n"
"The result is that the network will self-organize into a distributed, "
"clustered structure where nodes tend to hold data items that are close "
"together in key space. There will probably be multiple such clusters "
"throughout the network, any given document being replicated numerous times, "
"depending on how much it is used.\n"
"\n"
"### Freenet keys\n"
"\n"
"Each file that exists on Freenet has a key associated with it. Freenet 0.7 "
"has various types of keys. Keys are used for everything on freenet, and are "
"a kind of [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) "
"(e.g. freenet:=KSK@sample.txt).\n"
"\n"
"Most keys are hashes: there is no notion of semantic closeness when speaking "
"of key closeness. Therefore there will be no correlation between key "
"closeness and similar popularity of data as there might be if keys did "
"exhibit some semantic meaning, thus avoiding bottlenecks caused by popular "
"subjects.\n"
"\n"
"### Accessing data\n"
"\n"
"To access a particular piece of data on Freenet, you can use FProxy. You "
"need to know the key to the data, and enter it like this (or click a link "
"containing the key):\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\thttp://localhost:8888/[Freenet Key]</pre>\n"
"\n"
"There are four types of keys in Freenet:\n"
"\n"
"*   **CHK** - Content Hash Keys\n"
"*   **SSK** - Signed Subspace Keys\n"
"*   **USK** - Updateable Subspace Keys\n"
"*   **KSK** - Keyword Signed Keys\n"
"\n"
"CHKs are the most fundamental. All files over 1kB are ultimately divided "
"into one or more 32kB CHKs. CHKs' filenames are determined only by their "
"contents. SSKs are the other basic type. These combine a public key with a "
"human-readable filename and therefore allow for freesites. KSKs are a "
"variant of SSKs where everything is determined by a simple human readable "
"filename (e.g. =KSK@sample.txt). These are spammable but convenient in some "
"cases. And USKs are a form of updatable keys especially useful for freesites "
"and **Address Resolution Keys**.\n"
"\n"
"An Address Resolution Key (ARK) is an Updateable Subspace Key (USK) inserted "
"by the node whenever its IP address changes. It contains the reference for "
"the node - its cryptographic details, and in particular its IP address(es). "
"ARKs are a way to help people connect to Freenet if they have problems "
"caused by firewalls, routers or changing IP addresses. If someone cannot "
"accept incoming traffic it can make it difficult to connect.\n"
"\n"
"ARKs are an implementation detail and you don't need to know anything about "
"them to use Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"### Content Hash Keys\n"
"\n"
"Content Hash Keys are for files with static content, like an .mp3 or a PDF-"
"document. These keys are hashes of the content of the file. A hash is a "
"reproducible method of turning a specific piece of data into a relatively "
"small number that serve as a sort of *fingerprint* for the data. If the file "
"content changes, even ever so little, the hash of the file changes "
"radically. This makes the data hard to tamper with without anyone noticing. "
"A CHK uniquely identifies a file, it should not be possible for two files "
"with different content to have the same CHK. The CHK consists of three "
"parts:\n"
"\n"
"1.  the hash for the file\n"
"2.  the decryption key that unlocks the file, and\n"
"3.  the cryptographic settings used\n"
"\n"
"A typical CHK key looks like this:\n"
"\n"
"CHK@file hash,decryption key,crypto settings\n"
"\n"
"or for example:\n"
"\n"
"CHK@SVbD9~HM5nzf3AX4yFCBc-A4dhNUF5DPJZLL5NX5Brs,"
"bA7qLNJR7IXRKn6uS5PAySjIM6azPFvK~18kSi6bbNQ,AAEA--8\n"
"\n"
"The decryption key is stored encrypted within the file, so it is not "
"possible to decrypt the file without the CHK key.\n"
"\n"
"To access the file, the whole key must be pasted behind the FProxy address "
"(cut to fit screen):\n"
"\n"
"http://localhost:8888/CHK@SVbD9~[..]X5Brs,bA7qLN[..]Si6bbNQ,AAEA--8\n"
"\n"
"### Signed Subspace Keys\n"
"\n"
"Signed Subspace Keys are usually for sites that are going to change over "
"time. For example, a website that may need news to be updated or information "
"to be corrected, added or deleted. They work in such a way that someone else "
"can't put up a newer version of your site and pretend it was you who did "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"It works by using public-key cryptography so you can sign your site. Only "
"the person with the secret key can add updated versions of your site to "
"Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"Also the SSK consists of five parts:\n"
"\n"
"*   **public key hash** - This part is all that is required to uniquely "
"identify the file (but not decrypt it), so nodes need only store this bit. "
"The actual public key is stored (unencrypted) with the (encrypted) data.\n"
"*   **document decryption key** - This is only known to clients and not to "
"the nodes storing the data, so nodes cannot decrypt the data they store "
"without the full address.\n"
"*   **crypto settings** - Cryptographic algorithm used, etc.\n"
"*   **user selected name** - a word or sentence chosen by the site author.\n"
"*   **version** - the current version of the site.\n"
"\n"
"The version number is increased each time a new version of the site is "
"created and inserted into Freenet. This approach is used since it is not "
"currently possible to update already inserted data in Freenet. Updateable "
"Subspace Keys makes this more transparent to the user, see below.\n"
"\n"
"A typical SSK key looks like this:\n"
"\n"
"SSK@public key hash,decryption key,crypto settings/user selected name-"
"version\n"
"\n"
"For example (cut for screen purposes):\n"
"\n"
"SSK@GB3wuHmt[..]o-eHK35w,c63EzO7u[..]3YDduXDs,AQABAAE/mysite-4\n"
"\n"
"### How Signed Subspace Keys work\n"
"\n"
"*   The author generates a cryptographic keypair: a **private key** for "
"signing files and a **public key** for verifying the signature.\n"
"*   The author also generates a single **symmetric key** (one that is used "
"for both encrypting and decrypting).\n"
"*   When a file is inserted into Freenet, it is encrypted with the "
"**symmetric key** and signed with the **private key**. The signature is "
"stored with the file. Nodes don't store the **symmetric key**, only the "
"**public key** part of the SSK, as an index to the data. This is so they can "
"plausibly deny knowledge of the data on their node.\n"
"\n"
"The SSK is made up of a hash of the public key, and the symmetric key. The "
"hash of the public key acts as the index to the data for searching purposes. "
"Also, the actual public key is stored with the data. This is so that Freenet "
"nodes can verify the signature when the SSK file comes into their node, and "
"also so that clients can verify the signature when retrieving the file. The "
"symmetric key is so that clients can decrypt the file.\n"
"\n"
"Signed Subspace Key sites have largely been superseded by Updatable Subspace "
"Key (USK) sites, which are based on SSKs but allow for links that try to "
"always retrieve the most up-to-date version of the site.\n"
"\n"
"### Updateable Subspace Keys\n"
"\n"
"Updateable Subspace Keys are useful for linking to the latest version of a "
"Signed Subspace Key (SSK) site. Note that USKs are really just a user-"
"friendly wrapper around SSKs, which hide the process of searching for more "
"recent versions of a site.\n"
"\n"
"A typical USK key looks like this:\n"
"\n"
"USK@public key hash,decryption key,crypto settings/user selected name/"
"number/\n"
"\n"
"It is almost identical to the Signed Subspace Key, with the exception of the "
"version-number. There are two types of USK addresses:\n"
"\n"
"*   an USK with a positive number at the end, or\n"
"*   an USK with a negative number at the end.\n"
"\n"
"The USK with a **positive** number at the end works like this: the Freenet "
"node on your computer keeps a list of versions of USKs that it knows about, "
"without necessarily storing the data as well. This list is built up from "
"previous visits, and also background requests from previous visits to these "
"kind of links. When you visit an USK like the one below, it consults this "
"list for versions of the mysite site of number 5 or greater. If it finds "
"any, it return the latest one. Then, in the background, it searches for "
"**newer** versions that it doesn't yet know about to add to your USK "
"registry for the next time you visit the address.\n"
"\n"
"Example (cut for screen purposes):\n"
"\n"
"USK@GB3wuHmt[..]o-eHK35w,c63EzO7u[..]3YDduXDs,AQABAAE/mysite/5/\n"
"\n"
"When you visit a link with a **negative** number at the end, Freenet "
"searches for the version you requested (e.g. **-7**) plus four more (i.e. "
"7,8,9,10,11) at the node on your computer and on other nodes. If it finds "
"only version 7, it will return that. If it finds one of the others, it "
"searches for another batch of five versions: 12,13,14,15,16\\. It repeats "
"this until there are four consecutive versions it can't find. Then it will "
"return the latest version it has found so far.\n"
"\n"
"Example (cut for screen purposes):\n"
"\n"
"USK@GB3wuHmt[..]o-eHK35w,c63EzO7u[..]3YDduXDs,AQABAAE/mysite/-7/\n"
"\n"
"The real treat with USKs comes when data is to be inserted into Freenet. But "
"more on that elsewhere.\n"
"\n"
"### Keyword Signed Keys\n"
"\n"
"Keyword-Signed Keys (KSKs) allow you to save named pages in Freenet. They "
"are not secure against spamming or name hijacking. Several people could each "
"insert a different file to Freenet, all with the same address. However, "
"there is a collision detection, which tries to prevent overwriting of a once-"
"inserted page. A KSK address looks like this:\n"
"\n"
"KSK@myfile.txt\n"
"\n"
"The drawback to KSKs is that anyone can insert a file with the same name as "
"yours and divert traffic from your file to their own. The advantage is human "
"readable links that can be easily remembered.\n"
"\n"
"The KSK description should not contain slashes, just as with other keys "
"(slashes are used to denote Manifests or Containers).\n"
"\n"
"A KSK address can contain a redirection to a CHK address, or it can contain "
"the file itself.\n"
"\n"
"### Containers\n"
"\n"
"A container, in general Freenet terms, is a file that contains several other "
"files. In freenet 0.7, a freesite, or other collection of files, may be "
"bundled together in a ZIP file, which is limited in size to 2MB. Containers "
"have the advantage that when you load one page you load all the files on the "
"freesite, so either it loads in its entirety or it doesn't load at all, and "
"greatly reduce the number of keys required to insert a given freesite. "
"Containers are currently created transparently when inserting a freesite "
"using e.g. jSite.\n"
"\n"
"### Manifests\n"
"\n"
"A manifest contains metadata over the list of blocks a CHK is divided into "
"and some information about the content-type(MIME), the filenames and other "
"useful information. The main information is whether the CHK-key is a "
"splitfile or not, and whether the manifest is chained or not. You don't need "
"to know much about manifests in order to use Freenet, since it is a part "
"that is handled internally."

"Freemail is an email system for Freenet. It allows you to send anonymous "
"emails to other Freenet users using your standard email client. It is "
"currently not bundled in the Freenet installer, and has to be downloaded "
"separately. You can also try the Freemail plugin by selecting it from the "
"list on the plugins page of your Freenet node. Beware, though, that the "
"plugin is still in an early stage of development, and users should be active "
"about looking in log files and reporting problems if they find them.\n"
"\n"
"You can download the latest pre-compiled version from [https://downloads."
"freenetproject.org/alpha/plugins/Freemail/](https://downloads.freenetproject."
"org/alpha/plugins/Freemail/)\n"
"\n"
"### Easy account setup\n"
"\n"
"The easy way to set up a Freemail account is to visit the Freemail plugin, "
"after you have downloaded it, through your **Plugins** web page. The web "
"interface will prompt you for an IMAP name, an IMAP password, and a Freemail "
"shortname to associate with the account. When the account is created, it "
"will email you the secure name that it generated for you.\n"
"\n"
"The chosen short Freemail-address must be unique and will give you an "
"address looking like:\n"
"\n"
"*   <anything>@<short-Freemail-address>.freemail\n"
"\n"
"The <anything> before the @ will be ignored. It is only there because mail "
"user and transport agents want to see an @ in addresses. Yes, we _do_ know "
"this is an ugly kludge.\n"
"\n"
"Once you have installed the freemail plugin for your Freenet proxy daemon, "
"starting or restarting the daemon will start the freemail service for you "
"automatically.\n"
"\n"
"If for some reason you cannot make the web interface work, we have included "
"hand-configuration instructions down this page.\n"
"\n"
"### Mail client setup\n"
"\n"
"Now you have the Freemail proxy running, which means that you can send and "
"receive emails through Freenet. For this we recommend that you set up your "
"favorite email client to use the special Freenet private ports:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Incoming emails** - Protocol: **IMAP**, Server: **localhost**, Port: "
"**3143**\n"
"*   **Outgoing emails** - Protocol: **SMTP**, Server: **localhost**, Port: "
"**3025**\n"
"\n"
"Your Freemail plugin must be running while you are reading and sending "
"freemails. Leaving your node running, with the Freemail pugin enabled, will "
"ensure this. For debugging purposes, it is also possible to send and receive "
"Freemail mail with only the Freenet jar running.\n"
"\n"
"### Fetching Freemail mail with fetchmail\n"
"\n"
"You can easily make [fetchmail](http://fetchmail.berlios.de/) poll your "
"freenet mail with an entry like this:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tpoll freenet via localhost with proto imap port 3143\n"
"\tuser LOCALNAME here is IMAPNAME there with password PASSWORD</pre>\n"
"\n"
"This will cause Freemail mail to be automatically fetched and merged into "
"your normal incoming mail stream, so any of your email clients will see it. "
"Of course, you will need to change IMAPNAME and PASSWORD to match the "
"authetication pair you gave when you created the Freemail account, and "
"LOCALNAME to the local login you want to receive the mail.\n"
"\n"
"A variant of this recipe will still work if you have your freenet node. "
"running on another machine. Just change \"localhost\" to the DNS address of "
"the node host.\n"
"\n"
"### Thunderbird\n"
"\n"
"If you use Thunderbird as your email client:\n"
"\n"
"1.  From the Edit menu, select Account Settings.\n"
"2.  Click the Add Account... button.\n"
"3.  Select Email Account and click Next.\n"
"4.  Type in the name and either the long Freemail address you were given, or "
"your short address if you created one. Check this carefully as an incorrect "
"address here will not only mean people won't be able to reply to you, but "
"your messages will appear as 'Spoofed'. Once you've done this, click Next.\n"
"5.  Set the type of incoming server to IMAP and the incoming server name to "
"localhost. Then click Next.\n"
"6.  For the Incoming User Name, use the account name you chose earlier "
"('john' in this example), which may not be the same as your email address. "
"Click Next.\n"
"7.  Enter an arbitrary Account Name and click Next and then Finish.\n"
"8.  Now we have to change the IMAP port number from the default: On the left "
"panel click on Server Settings under the new account. Change the Port to "
"3143 from the default of 143.\n"
"\n"
"Now you should be able to read incoming freemails. To send out emails:\n"
"\n"
"1.  From the Edit menu, select Account Settings.\n"
"2.  In the left-hand panel, scroll down and click on the Outgoing Server "
"(SMTP) option.\n"
"3.  You probably already have at least one SMTP server set up already for "
"your normal emails. So click on the Add... button to create one specially "
"for freemails.\n"
"4.  Under Description put anything you want - Freemail might be a good "
"choice. Set Server Name to localhost and change Port to 3025\\. Make sure "
"'Use name and password' is checked and put your original account name as the "
"User Name ('john' in our example). 'Use secure connection' should be set to "
"No (don't worry, it's only the local connection that is unencrypted). Click "
"OK.\n"
"5.  The final thing is to set your new Freemail account to use this outgoing "
"server instead of the default one. So in the left panel find and click on "
"the top line of the new incoming mail account you added. In our example this "
"would be something like me@jsmith.freemail. There should be a drop-down box "
"called Outgoing Server (SMTP). Set this to the new setup we just added: "
"something like Freemail - localhost. And click OK.\n"
"\n"
"Congratulations - you're now set up to send and receive email over Freenet!\n"
"\n"
"### Hand configuration\n"
"\n"
"To set up an account for Freemail by hand, execute the following commands:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --newaccount <username>\n"
"\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --passwd <username> <password>\n"
"\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --shortaddress <username> <short-Freemail-address>\n"
"\tjava -jar Freemail.jar</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Exchange the values within <brackets> with the appropriate values.\n"
"\n"
"After running the last command you now have a running Freemail proxy, "
"listening on localhost at IMAP port 3143 for incoming mails, and SMTP port "
"3025 for outgoing mails. Connect to it using your favourite email client "
"software.\n"
"\n"
"If you didn't follow, here's a longer and more detailed recipe:\n"
"\n"
"### Account Setup\n"
"\n"
"Change to the directory containing the Freemail.jar file. At the command "
"line, type:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar</pre>\n"
"\n"
"If you are running Freemail for the first time, it will prompt you to create "
"an account:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tStarting Freemail for the first time.\n"
"\tYou will probably want to add an account by running Freemail with "
"arguments --newaccount <username></pre>\n"
"\n"
"So do what it says. The username you create here is used to authenticate to "
"the Freemail-service and will only be seen by you, it isn't part of your "
"freemail address:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --newaccount john</pre>\n"
"\n"
"It now generates your Freemail address which is a long random string like "
"**anything@DS3FG3R...SF6FHJ8YUK.freemail**. Generating the cryptographic "
"keypair is a computation-intensive process and may take a few minutes on a "
"slow machine.\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tGenerating mailsite keys...\n"
"\tMailsite keys generated.\n"
"\tYour Freemail address is: anything@DS3FG3R...SF6FHJ8YUK.freemail\n"
"\tGenerating cryptographic keypair (this could take a few minutes)...\n"
"\tAccount creation completed.\n"
"\tAccount created for john. You may now set a password with --passwd "
"<password></pre>\n"
"\n"
"The next step is to create a password for your account. The syntax to create "
"a password is shown below:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --passwd <username> <password></pre>\n"
"\n"
"To create the password **secretpass** for the user **john**, type:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --passwd john secretpass</pre>\n"
"\n"
"Now we have an account, a password for that account and a rather lengthy "
"Freemail-address. The problem is that not many people in the world will be "
"able to remember that Freemail-address. The solution to this problem is to "
"create a short address that points to the long one:\n"
"\n"
"To do this, run the main command again:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar</pre>\n"
"\n"
"and the software will prompt you to create a short Freemail address:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tSecure Freemail address: anything@DS3FG3R...SF6FHJ8YUK.freemail\n"
"\tYou don't have a short Freemail address. You could get one by running "
"Freemail\n"
"\twith the --shortaddress option, followed by your account name and the "
"name\n"
"\tyou'd like. For example, 'java -jar freemail.jar --shortaddress bob bob' "
"will give\n"
"\tyou the address 'anything@bob.freemail'. Try to pick something unique!\n"
"\ttrying slotinsert to freenet:SSK@sdfgsdfg...ertretert/mailsite-1/mailpage</"
"pre>\n"
"\n"
"The syntax to create a short freemail address is:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --shortaddress <username> <short address></"
"pre>\n"
"\n"
"To create an alias known as **jsmith** for user **john**, write:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar --shortaddress john jsmith</pre>\n"
"\n"
"If that short alias is free, it will tell you your Freemail address:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tSecure Freemail address: anything@DS3FG3R...SF6FHJ8YUK.freemail\n"
"\tShort Freemail address (*probably* secure): anything@jsmith.freemail</"
"pre>\n"
"\n"
"Now you have created a Freemail account, a long and a short address and set "
"up a password for the account. Now, all you need to do is to start the "
"Freemail proxy, to listen for incoming IMAP and SMTP connections. The "
"Freemail proxy must run while you use Freemail, or else no mails you send "
"will get delivered. To start the server, run the command:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar Freemail.jar</pre>\n"
"\n"
"### Troubleshooting tips\n"
"\n"
"If you try to run the Freemail jar and get messages that look like the "
"following:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\t24/12/2008 11:20:52 ERROR(freemail.smtp.SMTPListener): Error in SMTP "
"server - Address already in use\n"
"\t24/12/2008 11:20:52 ERROR(freemail.imap.IMAPListener): Error in IMAP "
"server - Address already in use</pre>\n"
"\n"
"...it probably means you downloaded the Freemail plugin through the Web "
"interface and your node is already running it. On a Linux machine you can "
"check to see if the private SMTP and IMAP ports are actually in use with "
"`netstat -tln`; the port numbers you're looking for in the listing are 3143 "
"(Freenet IMAP) and 3025 (Freenet SMTP).\n"
"\n"
"If you get these messages and these ports are _not_ in use, try shutting "
"down and restarting the node. If the problem persists after that, you have "
"found a bug and should file it with the Freenet developers.\n"
"\n"
"If the ports are indeed in use, check the **List of Plugins** on your "
"**Plugins**. If Freemail is in that list, then you can eaither unload it and "
"go through the manual procedure (running java -jar Freemail.jar) or "
"configure your Freemail account through the web interface."

"Frost is an application for Freenet that provides usenet-like message boards "
"and file uploading/downloading/sharing functionalities. It should get "
"installed with Freenet 0.7 automatically if you used the standard Freenet "
"installers.\n"
"\n"
"To run Frost on Linux from the command line, change to your Freenet install "
"directory, then change to the frost subdirectory. Then make the frost.sh "
"file executable, and run it:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tcd /home/username/\n"
"\tcd frost/\n"
"\tchmod +x ./frost.sh\n"
"\t./frost.sh</pre>\n"
"\n"
"The first time you start Frost, you will get a number of dialogs. The first "
"ask you if you would like to import old Frost data. If this is the first "
"time you use Freenet at all, you can safely answer **Clean startup** here.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/frost/clean-start.png)\n"
"\n"
"Since Freenet is able to run on both Freenet 0.5 and the current Freenet "
"0.7, you will need to specify which version you want to run with. If you "
"have followed the previous install instructions, you will probably want "
"**Freenet 0.7 (Darknet)**.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/frost/select-version.png)\n"
"\n"
"Next step is to choose which identidy you want to be known by when using "
"Frost. As it says, it does not have to be unique, but it certainly helps.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/frost/choose-identity.png)\n"
"\n"
"You will then get the main Frost window, where one can participate in the "
"message boards and up/download files. The windows will probably take a while "
"to populate on the first startup.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/frost/main-window.png)\n"
"\n"
"### Sharing files\n"
"\n"
"Sharing files can be done by clicking the **Shared files** -tab and then "

"jSite is a graphical application that you can use to create, insert and "
"manage your own Freenet sites. It was written in Java by Bombe.\n"
"\n"
"You can [download jSite here](https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/"
"jSite/jSite.jar)\n"
"\n"
"### Starting jSite\n"
"\n"
"To start jSite, type the following in a terminal:\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\tjava -jar jSite.jar</pre>\n"
"\n"
"The first window you see is this:\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/jsite/select-project.png)\n"
"\n"
"In the pane to the left, already created projects can be selected for "
"updating, deleting or cloning. Since this is the first start, no such "
"projects exist.\n"
"\n"
"### Creating a Freesite\n"
"\n"
"To create a new Freesite, you click the **Add project**-button. You then "
"need to fill in the details of the project. Under the Project information-"
"section:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Name** - this is just a name for you to know the project, so anything "
"will do. It may contain spaces.\n"
"*   **Description** - again, just a slightly longer description of the "
"project for you own convenience.\n"
"*   **Local Path** - This is a directory where you will store all the pages "
"of the freesite you are creating. Put in the full path. You can click the "
"Browse button to select a directory graphically or just type it in.\n"
"\n"
"Under the Address-section, there are some automatically generated entries, "
"and the human readable name for the site, as seen in the address-field of "
"the browser:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Request URI** - this is filled in automatically and should be a long "
"string of seemingly random characters\n"
"*   **Insert URI** - this is also filled in automatically and will look "
"similar to the Request URI..\n"
"*   **Path** - You need to enter a single word here without spaces. This "
"will appear at the end of the address of your site. You can't leave this "
"blank.\n"
"\n"
"Below is an example of how it might look:\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/jsite/project-details.png)\n"
"\n"
"When everything is filled in correctly, you may press **Next**.\n"
"\n"
"The next step is to add files to your Freenet site (or Freesite). This is "
"done in the dialog called **Project Files**. Since we have no files in the "
"current directory, yet, the dialog is pretty much empty.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/jsite/project-files.png)\n"
"\n"
"To add files, we put some files in the local directory we specified earlier, "
"**/home/test**, and press **Re-scan**. Then, presto, the files appear.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/jsite/default-file.png)\n"
"\n"
"We then highlight one of these files that will be the default page (e.g. "
"index.html might be a good choice) and check the **Default file** checkbox. "
"It should recognise the MIME type as text/html, so leave everything else as "
"they are and click the **Insert now** button.\n"
"\n"
"If all goes well, a window like the one below should appear. It may take "
"quite a while to insert the Freesite, several minutes in fact.\n"
"\n"
"![](assets/img/jsite/project-insert.png)\n"
"\n"
"When all is finished, you will get a message pop-up that tells you that the "
"site has been inserted successfully. You can copy the URI to the clip-board "
"by clicking the **Copy URI to Clipboard** -button.\n"
"\n"
"Then you can use FProxy to surf to your newly created Freesite. Just paste "
"the URI after the\n"
"\n"
"[http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)\n"
"\n"
"in the browser address bar, like this (cut for screen purposes):\n"

"</pre>\n"
